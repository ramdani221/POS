# Point Of Sale (POS)

## Introduction

This is full stack React application which provides a solid starting point for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org),[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) based applications. Client side code and the backend API is written using NextJS.

Point of Sales or POS is a payment system that can facilitate transactions. POS can help in quick calculations,
store customer data, calculate profits and losses, and recap sales reports.

## Before You Begin

Before you begin i recommend you to read about the basic building blocks that assemble this application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through it's [Official Website](https://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics.
* ReactJS - React's [Official Website](https://reactjs.org/) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) which should get you going with the Node.js platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
